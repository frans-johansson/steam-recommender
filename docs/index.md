## Introduction

Hello! This tutorial blog will walk you through the steps to implement your very own recommender system. In our case, the recommender system has been designed to work with the [Steam gaming platform][steam], but the ideas could really be applied to any platform you can imagine!

First and foremost, we believe some introductions are in order. We are three Master's degree students in Media Technology at Link√∂ping University, and we are the ones taking you on this journey down recommender system lane:

### So what is a recommender system?

A recommender system is a sub-class of information filtering system that seeks to predict the rating or preference a user would give an item. Most big companies you know of (including Valve, the company behind the Steam platform) already use them to great effect in order to provide their user-base with a continous feed of relevant items, e.g. games, movies, songs, to consume. With that said, the purpose of this project was not to innovate, but rather to explore the problem of constructing a recommender system from a data scientific point of view. And hopefully, by reading this, you will be equipped with the knowledge and ideas to go out there and make something neat of your own.

The types of recommender systems we will examine can be categorized as either *content-based* methods or *collaborative filtering* methods. The former considers various descriptors of the items the users might be interested in, e.g. genre, developer or description, while the latter considers item-user interactions with the main idea being "similar users like similar items". These ideas will be elaborated further in their corresponding sections of this blog.

With all this in mind, we are ready to delve into the meat of the problem: what do we need to start constructing our recommender systems?
